# airbnb-clone-project

## Overview
This project is a full-stack web application, developed as a clone of Airbnb using Django, MySQL, and GraphQL. It replicates the core functionality of Airbnb by allowing users to create accounts, browse property listings, check availability, and make bookings. The project also includes secure API development, database design for managing users, listings, and reservations, as well as CI/CD pipeline integration with Docker and GitHub Actions to simulate a real-world deployment workflow.
